/**
This protocol should be implemented by every service that will be used with an instance of `Trekker`. 
To support specific features for analytics tracking, you can implement the following protocols next to `TrekkerService`:
- `TrekkerEventAnalytics` to track events.
- `TrekkerTimedEventAnalytics` to track timed events.
- `TrekkerPushNotificationAnalytics` to track push notification and retrieve the push notification token.
- `TrekkerUserProfileAnalytics` to support identifying the user with some information.
- `TrekkerEventSuperPropertiesAnalytics` to support event super properties, properties that should be added to every (timed)event tracked.
 
- important: `versionString` has to represent the version of the SDK used for the service or a self assigned version if an SDK is not used.
